- Local Storage

# 5 features of my website/project
1. This is a SPA- Single Page Application created with React JavaScript Library.
2. React Router is used for the first time (by me) for navigating between pages. Also the background color of the navbar changes when a user navigates to a different route/page from the Home page.
3. For the first time, I have used Local Storage for handling and managing data.
4. Different toast messages are shown for different activities in the local storage.
5. Besides, I have disabled the wishlist button so that the same gadget/item cannot be added to the wishlist more than once.
